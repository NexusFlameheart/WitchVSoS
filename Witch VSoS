This does little to stop witch hunting and burnings, but provides some measure of safety from them.",

While two or more members of your coven are within 30 feet of one another, they gain the ability to cast additional spells, as shown on the Coven Spellcasting table. Additionally, members of your coven gain access to a shared pool of 5 spell slots— one of each level, from 1st to 5th level—which they can use to cast any spell known to them. Expended spell slots are regained when all members of the coven finish a long rest. Coven members use their own spellcasting ability to determine spell attack bonuses and spell save DCs. A coven member can’t cast spells of a level for which they do not have personal spell slots, even if using a higher level shared spell slot. A shared spell slot can be used, for instance, to cast a lower level spell at higher levels, but it can’t be used to cast a spell normally too high-level for a spellcaster.
